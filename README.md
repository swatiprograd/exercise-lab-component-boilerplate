### Learning Goals:
The aim of this exercise is to practice and understand the importance of components.

### Steps to follow:

1. Clone this repository.

2. On your terminal go inside `exercise-lab-components-boilerplate` directory and use the following command: `npm install`.This command install's all the packages to your system that this project is using.
Here is a link to get a better understanding of what and how exactly the above command works.

3. Once everything is ready, you can type `npm start` -> inorder to run the application. You should be able to see a server running and see the output as shown below:

### Task:

By using `jsx`, we were able to simply our app a little, but again, we can see that, if our application becomes more complicated, then everything being inside `index.js`, will just populate the entire file. What if - there is a bug; how will we find as where exactly that bug is coming from -- if the entire code for our application is inside a sinlge file. So, as our project becomes more complex, keeping our entire code in a single file do not make much sense. So your task is to create a component as `App.js` - and transfer your entire logic to this component. The logic is already provided to you in `index.js` file.
